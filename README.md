# 🎬 High Rated Movies – Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes a dataset of movies and filters out those with a rating of **8 or higher**. It also visualizes movie ratings and genre distribution using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.

## 📁 Files Included

- `movies.csv.txt` – Original movie dataset (CSV format).
- `high_rated_movies.csv` – Filtered dataset with movies rated 8 or above.
- `main.py` or `.ipynb` – Python code for data processing and visualization.
- `README.md` – Project description and usage guide.

## 🛠️ What This Project Does

- Loads a dataset of movies.
- Filters out movies with ratings ≥ 8.
- Saves the filtered list into a new CSV file.
- Plots:
  - A line chart showing movie titles vs ratings.
  - A bar chart showing the number of movies by genre.

## 📊 Visualization Samples

- ✅ **Line Plot:** Movie Titles vs Ratings  
- ✅ **Bar Chart:** Number of Movies per Genre

## 📚 Libraries Used
